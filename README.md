<b>Project Concept</b>

The main goal of this project is to get the pet owners (or ideally known as pet lovers) to know of any interesting events nearby for their beloved pets. The application was built with the sole purpose of bringing the pets together and make it entertaining for the pets and owners too. The application helps user with creating events and connecting other people with same interests. It’s a small gesture to make the world a better place in such crucial times. At the end it’s the little things that matter.
